Introduction
============

*The Cannon* is a data-driven method for determining stellar parameters 
and chemical abundances from stellar spectra in the context of large 
spectroscopic surveys. 
The method uses no physical stellar models, is very fast, 
and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines 
using significantly lower SNR spectra; 
it requires only a set of objects observed in common between the surveys. 
Because of these strengths, it has been used to
bring different stellar surveys onto a consistent physical scale,
and even transfer information from one survey to another.

For a more detailed description, see `Ness et al. 2015`_.
